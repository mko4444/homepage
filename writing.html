            Ford's $5-a-day plan vs. Bezos' sovereign nation
          </a>
          <p>
            Our most recent issue discusses Henry Ford's plan to double his employees' salaries. Every issue of The Paper highlights some underlying point or fact of reality in today's world. This week is no exception. Decisions that corporations make, intentional or not, affect the world around them.

            Take the example of Ford. His $5-a-day plan was a massive event that reshaped the entire manufacturing industry. Before Ford's announcement, all factories were subject to the same issues. A high risk of death; long workdays; low pay; and an almost ubiquitous poverty. But after January 5, 1914, Ford's factories were different. He didn't improve any of the actual conditions in these factories– it was still a terrible job to take. In fact, life wasn't even that good on his $5 a day salary. Imagine making $30k a year instead of $15k in 2018. Still not great. But when everyone is making $15k and knows you're making more, there is quite a difference. And everyone knew about the Ford $5-a-day plan. It was the talk of the town, and every town. Newspapers around the world covered it. People came from all over the country looking for work. Even people working in other industries sought out jobs in Ford's factories. This was not an accident. Ford expected this kind of maddening response. He was a businessman and a showman, pouncing on an opportunity to crush his competition.

            This corporate fanfare should sound familiar because of a single company: Amazon. Jeff Bezos loves these two-sided efforts. HQ2. October's wage increase. Prime Day. Don't get me wrong, every company loves to promote its actions as if they are changing the world for the better. There's a whole division for it and it's called CSR. But make no mistake, Amazon is different. Steve Jobs was a showman for sure, but when Apple builds a new headquarters it does not pull an "HQ2." Alibaba's Singles' Day makes Prime Day look like any random Tuesday– and how often do you hear about it? Amazon makes a show of everything it does, and the reason they do it is always the same: profit. But unlike most other companies, even the smallest action by Amazon affects everyone. Like Ford's plan in 1914, if Amazon raises wages, every other retail company has to fight to match it. And like Ford, Amazon's entire business is in creating efficiency that no one else can match. But, even though Ford rocketed past the competition, it still had competition. In 1920, it had 200 competitors, and in 1940 it had 16. Impressive. But how many true competitors does Amazon have?

            It's true, Amazon's wage increase wasn't as massive at the time as Ford's. But it won't matter. The long term effects will be the same. This is their game, and we've seen it play out before.
