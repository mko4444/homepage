          <span class="bold">Sapiens, Noah Yuval Harari:</span> This book has changed the way I see the world and our place in it. But I struck less by the actual text than I was by Harari's call to challenge the world around us. Constructs like religion, biology, and societyâ€“ almost everyone would accept these as "untouchable." Each is a world in its own right, out of which every part of our reality has grown. But Sapiens forces the reader to question the defensibility of these ideas. Are countries living and breathing, or are they little more than ideas we have all chosen to accept? Was our evolution one of literal transformation, or rather natural selection? And if we were the surviving species of Homo, what did we do to eradicate the others? One by one, Harari calls up our most accepted beliefs and then dares to challenge them one by one.
